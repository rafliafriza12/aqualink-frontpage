```

---

### 2. ✅ **RAB Payment System** (FIXED)

#### What Was Wrong:

```
❌ Used updateRABPaymentStatus (manual flag)
❌ No Midtrans integration
❌ No actual payment gateway
❌ Inconsistent with billing flow
```

#### What Was Fixed:

```
✅ Created createRABPayment API call
✅ Added useMidtrans hook integration
✅ Midtrans Snap popup payment
✅ Consistent with billing flow
✅ Loading states
✅ Error handling
✅ Snap ready check
```

#### Frontend (`/profile/rab-payment`)

```
✅ useCreateRABPayment mutation
✅ useMidtrans hook
✅ Midtrans Snap popup
✅ Success callback → redirect to /profile
✅ Pending callback → show message
✅ Error callback → show toast
✅ Close callback → reset loading
✅ isSnapLoaded check
✅ Loading state management
```

#### Backend

```
✅ POST /api/rab-connection/:rabId/pay
✅ Creates Midtrans transaction
✅ Order ID: RAB-{rabId}
✅ Returns snap token
✅ Webhook handles RAB-* order IDs
✅ Updates isPaid and paidAt
✅ Sends notification
```

#### Services

```
✅ RABService.createPayment()
✅ createRABPayment() function
✅ useCreateRABPayment() hook
✅ Type safety
```

---

### 3. ✅ **Riwayat Tagihan (Billing History)**

#### Frontend (`/riwayat-tagihan`)

```
✅ Displays billing history
✅ useGetMyBilling mutation
✅ Shows all billings (paid and unpaid)
✅ Loading state
✅ Empty state with message
✅ RiwaayatTagihanCard component
✅ Proper formatting
```

#### Backend

```
✅ GET /api/billing/my
✅ Returns all user billings
✅ Includes payment details
✅ Sorted by date
```

#### Status: **WORKING CORRECTLY**

- Uses correct API endpoint
- Shows historical data
- Good UX with loading/empty states

---

### 4. ✅ **Notification System**

#### Implementation

```
✅ 12 notification links implemented
✅ NotificationService created
✅ NotificationBell component created
✅ Auto-refresh every 30s
✅ Unread count badge
✅ Click to navigate
✅ Mark as read
✅ Category color coding
```

#### Notification Links

```
Event → Link:
✅ New billing → /pembayaran
✅ Overdue billing → /pembayaran
✅ Payment reminder → /pembayaran
✅ Payment success → /riwayat-tagihan
✅ Payment failed → /pembayaran
✅ RAB payment success → /profile
✅ Wallet top-up success → /pembayaran
```

---

### 5. ✅ **Webhook System**

#### Consolidated Architecture

```
Before: 3 endpoints (confusing, duplicates)
After: 2 endpoints (clear separation)

✅ POST /api/webhook/payment
   - Handles: BILLING-*, BILLING-MULTI-*, RAB-*
   - Controller: paymentWebhookController.js

✅ POST /api/midtrans/notification
   - Handles: UUID (wallet top-up)
   - Controller: payment.js (webhookMidtrans)
```

#### Order ID Handling

```
✅ BILLING-{id} → Single billing payment
✅ BILLING-MULTI-{userId}-{timestamp} → Multiple billings
✅ RAB-{rabId} → RAB payment
✅ UUID → Wallet top-up
```

---

### 6. ✅ **Bug Fixes**

#### pemakaianBelumTerbayar Bug

```
❌ Before:
   - Double counting (increment + reset)
   - Reset to 0 on payment
   - Incorrect balance tracking

✅ After:
   - Only increment from IoT
   - Decrement (not reset) on payment
   - Correct balance tracking
```

#### Multiple Bills Payment

```
❌ Before:
   - No way to pay multiple bills at once
   - Had to pay one by one

✅ After:
   - Pay all via Midtrans (createPaymentForAllBills)
   - Pay all via Wallet (payAllBilling)
   - Shows summary (total bills, total amount)
```

#### Duplicate Webhooks

```
❌ Before:
   - 3 webhook endpoints
   - Duplicate code in billingController
   - ~400 lines of duplicate code

✅ After:
   - 2 webhook endpoints
   - Clean separation
   - Removed ~400 lines of duplicates
```
